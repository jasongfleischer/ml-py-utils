Utilities for doing machine learning in python; most of this is for sklearn/pandas operations

**balanced_resample_indices.py** Many classification algorithms will exhibit a bias towards classes that are more common in the data. When your dataset is unbalanced in the numbers of samples form each class you can use this utility to resample the data as you would prefer to see it.

**fit_and_check.py** When you need to find out if empirical data might reasonably be described as coming from a hypothesized distribution, you can use this routine to check if that's a reasonable hypothesis.
